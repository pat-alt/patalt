I am an economist by background with a strong interest in cross-disciplinary research on the intersection of interpretable artificial intelligence (AI), causal inference, economics and finance. Currently I am studying for the MSc Data Science at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. I am also affiliated with the Bank of England where I previously worked as an economist mainly focused on monetary policy briefings, research and market intelligence. On this website I collect interesting pieces of work I produce along the way and anything else I feel worth sharing.
