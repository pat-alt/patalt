I am currently studying for the MSc Data Science at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. Previously I worked professionally as an economist for Bank of England mainly focused on monetary policy briefing, research and market intelligence. I am interested in cross-disciplinary research on the intersection of interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) and financial economics. On this website I collect interesting pieces of work I produce along the way and anything else I feel worth sharing.
