I am an economist by background with a strong interest in corss-disciplinary research on the intersection of interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) and financial economics. Currently I am studying for the MSc Data Science at the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics. Previously I worked as an economist for Bank of England mainly focused on monetary policy briefing, research and market intelligence. On this website I collect interesting pieces of work I produce along the way and anything else I feel worth sharing.
